## Reflections
### Thoughts
This was a difficult project to undertake, as it tied together a wide range of skills developed throughout learning front end development. However, it provided many learning opportunities, particularly in the scope of authentication and database structure.

### Further improvements
- Implement a settings page, where users can add/change their profile pictures or username. 
- Add the ability to upload images.
- Allow users to change the theme.
- Further styling and css improvements.
